# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Apply the data science methodology to predict whether a Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land, to approximate potential cost savings and guide launch decision insights.

This repo contains my end-to-end capstone for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The goal is to predict whether a Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully using public data, and to explore which factors (orbit, payload mass, launch site, booster version, etc.) matter most.

Whatâ€™s inside:

  Data collection: REST API pulls + web scraping of Wikipedia launch tables.
  
  Wrangling & EDA: pandas/NumPy, exploratory SQL queries, visualizations.
  
  Geospatial: Folium map of launch/landing locations.
  
  Modeling: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees/Random Forest with cross-validation and basic hyperparameter tuning.
  
  Dashboard: lightweight Plotly Dash app for interactive exploration.
  
  Reports: figures, a short write-up, and slides summarizing results.
